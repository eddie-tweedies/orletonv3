    <p>Orleton Village Hall is situated in a convenient location in rural Herefordshire between Ludlow and Leominster and can only be fully appreciated with a visit.</p>
    <p>We do hope that you will arrange to see us at your earliest convenience. Appointments for viewing can be arranged for any time of the day.</p>
    <p>The hall can accommodate a wedding party of up to 130 with ample parking in our recently resurfaced car park.</p>
    <p>The cost of hiring the Hall can be from as little as £350 (Friday evening until Sunday noon) 
        The hire includes use of tables. chairs, crockery and cutlery. The small hall can be used as a bar area 
        and there is use of what is possibly the best equipped kitchen in North Herefordshire for your caterer. 
        You are most welcome to add more decoration to personalise the venue. Heating, lighting and sound systems are included in the cost.</p>

<p>The Hall has an audio visual system and free WiFi. So you are able to show wedding messages from abroad on the big electrically operated screen.</p>

<p>As the Hall has a full stage, rearrangement of tables after the wedding breakfast would facilitate dancing to a live band. 
    Alternatively, the in-house sound system can be used to play your own choice of music.</p>
