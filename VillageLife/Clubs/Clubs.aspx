				<p><em>Orleton is fortunate to have 4.5 hectares (11 acres) of land for recreational activities, situated to the 
					north of the village. It fills the shallow U of the main housing areas and is accessed from the Village Hall 
					and Mortimer Drive.</em></p>
					<p><em>Orleton has a long history of village football and cricket teams played on rented land. 
					In 1988 the pitch was bought, together with adjacent land, with a combination of fundraising and grants 
					from various agencies including the Parish Council. It is administered by the Recreation Association, 
					comprising village organisations, with the Parish Council as Custodian Trustee.</em></p>
					<p><em>In 1988 the land was leveled and re-sown by the farming community and a pavilion was built by volunteers. 
					Four acres of community woodland, funded with a Forestry Grant, was planted by an army of volunteers and 
					every school child.</em></p>

				Contact: Sue Copson</p>
				<p><em>Short mat bowling is an increasingly popular indoor sport.<br />
					It is played on a mat with normal woods and a jack, but, as a challenge to their skill, 
					bowlers have to avoid a block of wood placed as an obstacle at the centre of the mat.<br />
					The Orleton club exists purely for the enjoyment and social company that the game offers, 
					rather than for organised competition with other clubs, although the fun of playing does 
					not exclude some friendly rivalry.<br />
					The sport was started in Orleton in 2002 and the Club plays in the village hall on 
					Wednesday afternoons of each week, except for the months of April to August, when players’ 
					thoughts turn to traditional outdoor bowls.</em></p>
