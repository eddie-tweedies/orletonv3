			<h4>Orleton School</h4>
			<p>Everyone challenged, included and happy</p>
			<p><em>Our aim is to educate the whole child, giving them the skills to flourish in the global community 
				of the 21st century. We believe in the old fashioned values of good manners, academic rigour, 
				consideration of others, self-control and community spirit as a basis for developing independent 
				learners with enquiring minds. <br />
				Orleton is a one form entry School meaning we are big enough to 
				have outstanding facilities and staff expertise but are small enough to know children as individuals.</em></p>
			<p><em>All members of the School work to our School Mission Statement:
				To be the best we can!<br />
				The school has a well equipped kitchen providing a cooked lunch for both children and staff on a 
				daily basis. We are a Food for Life Flagship School which reflects the quality of our menus and our 
				commitment to educating the children about the food chain.</em></p>
			<p><em>Our range of Extended Schools Clubs is run on a termly basis and has included art, netball, 
				cross country, cookery and martial arts. In addition, we have very close links with 
				Orleton Pre-School Group, situated on the same site, which provides additional after school care.</em></p>
