<h1>Orleton History Group</h1>
<p><span class="newstext">The History Group has been recently formed and meets regularly in the village.</span></p>
<p>This is a relaxed and informal group of people who are interested in finding out more about our local village history - 
	from medieval times (and earlier!) to the present day. We're not academic historians but we do do our own research, 
	under the guidance of professionals such as the staff at Herefordshire Archives service.</p>

<h1>The History of Orleton</h1>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-9 col-sm-9 col-xs-11">
			<p>At the end of the ice age a glacier melted in this area forming "Lake Woofferton";
				eventually resulting in a valleyed, fertile area. It remained as such, blessed with
				a ready supply of water via a stream (Mill Brook) flowing from surrounding hills,
				with a ford crossing point and sheltered, low lying land. A natural place to attract
				a settlement, this area, at the time of Domesday Book, became known as Alretvne
				(the enclosure of the alders). We still have them along our stream today.</p>
			<p>The manor of Orleton was given by William the Conqueror to Ralph de Mortimer. It
				contained "4 hides of land which pay tax. In Lordship there are 4 plough teams with
				11 villagers, 15 smallholders, a reeve (magistrate) and a rider; between them 7
				ploughs, 6 slaves, 5 ploughmen and a smith." A hide was a measure of land which
				could be ploughed by one man with an ox in one year. This could vary from 160 acres
				to 20 depending on land quality.</p>
			<p>For many centuries the settlement revolved around agriculture and was self sufficient
				with its local produce, smiths, cobblers, clog makers, millers, stone masons, wheelwrights
				and carpenters.</p>
			<p>In 1855 a public elementary school and school master's residence was built in a
				19th century style, with a capacity for 99 pupils, to serve the community. The population
				in 1911 was 584 and there were 132 houses in the whole parish.</p>
			<p>There were no street names but "Kings Road" was the same in appearance as it had
				been since early Victorian times, whereas "Millbrook Way" had a farmhouse and buildings
				plus four cottages. The roadside was lined with damson trees.</p>
			<p>The first major developments were Hallets Well and Green Lane Council Houses after
				World War ll in the early 1950s.</p>
			<p>The community still employed many of its inhabitants on farms and sawmills, whilst
				virtually every woman relied on seasonal farm work to supplement income.</p>
			<p>More commuting to work and schools, media accessibility and urban inhabitants spurred
				change in the 1960s. Orleton wanted to have the same amenities as other places and
				eventually the District Council agreed to provide mains water and sewerage.</p>
